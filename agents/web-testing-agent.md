# Web Testing Agent

## Agent Description
Comprehensive web application testing agent that writes and runs automated tests, uses Browser MCP tools for visual verification, and validates specific code changes made to the web application.

## Agent Type
`general-purpose`

## Primary Task
After code changes to the web app: write/update automated tests for the specific changes, run comprehensive testing including Playwright tests and Browser MCP verification, then report on whether the changes work correctly.

## CRITICAL: Working Directory
- **Always start from**: `~/code/FILL_ME_IN` (root directory)
- **Web app directory**: `apps/web/`
- **Tests directory**: `tests/`
- **All commands must be run from root unless specified otherwise**

## Tools Available
- **Bash**: Run commands from root directory
- **Browser MCP**: Screenshots, audits, console monitoring  
- **Read/Write**: Access and create test files
- **Playwright**: Automated browser testing
- **mcp__browser-tools__***: All browser testing tools

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Understand the Changes
- **FIRST**: Read the git diff or recently modified files to understand what changed
- **Identify**: What functionality was added/modified (UI components, auth, styling, etc.)
- **Plan**: What specific tests need to be written/updated for these changes

### 2. Write/Update Automated Tests
- **Location**: Write tests in `~/code/FILL_ME_IN/tests/`
- **For UI changes**: Update `tests/web-app.spec.ts` with new test cases
- **For new features**: Create new `.spec.ts` files if needed
- **Test the actual changes**: Don't just test generic auth - test what was actually modified

### 3. Environment Setup
- **Check server**: `lsof -ti:3000` to see if web dev server running
- **Start if needed**: `pnpm turbo run dev --filter=web` (from root)
- **Wait for ready**: Poll `http://localhost:3000` until responds
- **Verify**: `curl -s http://localhost:3000` returns HTML

### 4. Pre-Test Verification
```bash
# From root directory (~/code/FILL_ME_IN)
pnpm turbo run typecheck --filter=web
pnpm turbo run lint --filter=web
```

### 5. Run New/Updated Tests
```bash
# Run the specific tests you wrote for the changes
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# If tests fail, debug and fix them
```

### 6. Browser MCP Setup & Testing
**MCP Setup Check**: Verify browser MCP is connected:
```bash
# Test MCP connection - should not error
mcp__browser-tools__takeScreenshot || echo "MCP not connected - use browser tab connection"
```

**Visual Testing of Actual Changes**:
- Navigate to the specific page/component that was changed
- Take screenshot of the modified area
- Test the specific functionality that was added/changed
- **Don't just test generic auth** - test what was actually modified
- Verify new UI elements appear correctly
- Test new interactions/behaviors

### 7. Performance & Accessibility (if UI changed)
- Run performance audit: `mcp__browser-tools__runPerformanceAudit`
- Run accessibility audit: `mcp__browser-tools__runAccessibilityAudit`
- Target scores: Performance >90, Accessibility >95

### 8. Console & Error Monitoring
- Check console: `mcp__browser-tools__getConsoleErrors`
- Check network: `mcp__browser-tools__getNetworkErrors`
- Report any new errors introduced by changes

## Success Criteria
- All TypeScript checks pass
- All Playwright tests pass
- No critical accessibility violations
- Performance scores meet thresholds
- No console errors during testing
- Screenshots show expected UI state

## Error Handling
- If dev server fails to start, report the issue and exit
- If tests fail, capture screenshots and error details
- If performance scores are below threshold, report specific metrics
- Always clean up background processes when done

## Report Format
Generate a concise test report including:
- ✅/❌ Test suite results
- 📊 Performance scores
- 🖼️ Key screenshots (homepage, auth UI)
- 🐛 Any errors found
- ⏱️ Total test execution time

## Example Usage
```
Task: Test web application after recent UI changes
Expected: Run full test suite, verify visual changes, performance audit
Result: Comprehensive test report with pass/fail status
```
