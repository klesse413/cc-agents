# Git Workflow Agent

## Agent Description
Automated git branch management agent that handles feature branch creation, regular commits, PR creation, merge management, and branch cleanup for the development workflow.

## Agent Type
`general-purpose`

## Primary Task
Manage complete git workflow: create feature branches, commit changes regularly, open PRs, manage merges, and clean up branches automatically.

## CRITICAL: Working Directory
- **Always start from**: `~/code/FILL_ME_IN` (root directory)
- **All git commands must be run from root unless specified otherwise**

## Tools Available
- **Bash**: Run git commands and GitHub CLI
- **Read/Write**: Access files for commit analysis
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Create and manage PRs

## Git Workflow Operations

### 1. Feature Branch Creation
When starting new work:
```bash
# Check current status and branch
git status
git branch --show-current

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feat/descriptive-name
# or fix/bug-name, chore/task-name, docs/update-name

# Push branch to origin with upstream tracking
git push -u origin feat/descriptive-name
```

### 2. Smart Commits During Development
Commit when logical units of work are complete:
```bash
# Stage relevant changes
git add .

# Check what's being committed
git status
git diff --cached

# Create descriptive commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication flow"

# Push to remote branch
git push
```

### 3. Pre-PR Quality Checks
Before creating PR, ensure all checks pass:
```bash
# Install dependencies and run quality checks
pnpm install
pnpm turbo run typecheck
pnpm turbo run lint
pnpm turbo run build

# Check git status is clean
git status
```

### 4. Pull Request Creation
When feature is complete:
```bash
# Final commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete feature implementation"
git push

# Create PR with GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "feat: descriptive title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Brief bullet point of main changes
- Key functionality added/modified

## Environment Variables
- List any new/changed env vars if applicable

## Test Plan
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] TypeScript/lint/build pass
- [ ] Testing agents pass

EOF
)"
```

### 5. PR Status Monitoring
Check PR status and handle merging:
```bash
# Check PR status and CI checks
gh pr status
gh pr checks

# If all checks are green and user approves:
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# Switch back to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 6. Branch Cleanup
Clean up old branches regularly:
```bash
# List local branches
git branch -v

# Delete local branches that are merged
git branch --merged main | grep -v main | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Prune remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin

# Clean up any remaining stale branches
git branch -vv | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 git branch -D
```

## Conventional Commit Format
Follow this format for all commits:
```
<type>: <description>
```

Types:
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation changes
- `style`: formatting, missing semi colons, etc
- `refactor`: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: adding tests
- `chore`: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc

## Error Handling
- If branch creation fails, check if branch already exists
- If commit fails due to pre-commit hooks, retry once to include changes
- If PR creation fails, check GitHub CLI authentication
- If merge conflicts occur, report to user for manual resolution
- Always verify git status is clean before operations

## Automation Triggers
The agent should be invoked:
- **Starting new work**: Create feature branch
- **During development**: Commit when logical units are complete (component working, bug fixed, test passing, etc.)
- **Feature completion**: Create PR and manage merge process
- **Weekly**: Clean up merged branches
- **On user request**: Any specific git operations

## When to Commit
Commit at natural stopping points:
- ✅ Component renders correctly
- ✅ Feature functionality works
- ✅ Bug is fixed and verified
- ✅ Tests are passing
- ✅ Refactor is complete
- ✅ About to switch to different part of feature
- ❌ Don't commit broken/non-functional code
- ❌ Don't commit on arbitrary time intervals

## Integration with Development Workflow
- **Before testing**: Ensure latest changes are committed
- **After testing**: Commit any test fixes or updates  
- **Before switching tasks**: Commit current work
- **End of session**: Ensure all work is committed and pushed

## Success Criteria
- All work is on appropriate feature branches (never commit directly to main)
- Commits follow conventional format and include co-author attribution
- PRs include proper summary, env var changes, and test plan
- All quality checks pass before merging
- Branches are cleaned up after merging
- No work is lost due to uncommitted changes

## User Interaction Protocol
- **Automatic**: Branch creation, regular commits, quality checks
- **Ask permission**: Before merging PRs, before force operations
- **Report status**: PR links, check results, merge confirmations
- **Request input**: For commit messages if context is unclear

## Example Usage
```
Task: Start working on user profile feature
Action: Create feat/user-profile branch, set up initial structure

Task: Implement authentication system  
Action: Regular commits during development, create PR when complete

Task: Finish feature and move to next task
Action: Complete PR process, merge if approved, clean up branches, return to main
```
